- 👋 Hi, I’m @sswart-eb
- 👀 I’m interested in sunny afternoons on the patio, as well as everything EB that benefits our customers, candidates, colleagues or drives our transformation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and javascript basics in my spare time, plus always reading about all things data engineering and business intelligence. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things RevOps. See our Confluence page here: https://ebpp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RA/overview
- 📫 Reach me via Teams.
